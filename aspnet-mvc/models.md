# Models
Model:  
Application data and behaviour in terms of its problem domain, and independent of the UI.

Domain Model of the movie app (classes):
- Movie
- Customer
- Rental
- Transaction

These classes have properties and methods which represent the application state and rules. They are not tied to the user interface, meaning they could be used the same for a desktop or mobile app.
